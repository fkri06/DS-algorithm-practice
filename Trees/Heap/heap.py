# Heap implementation using doubly linked list.
# Basic Heap operation:
#	- Insert -> insert an element to a heap. Insertion
#         in a Heap always start from the bottom/end of list/array.
#
#	- Remove -> remove the root element from a heap. Deletion
#         in a Heap always delete the root node, and then from there
#         fix the heap arrangements.
